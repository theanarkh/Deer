# Deer: Javascript Runtime

1. Javascript Runtime.
2. Just for fun.
3. Based on `V8` 10.8 and `kqueue` currently.

# How to use
1. ./install.sh
2. node test/tcp/client.js

# Tips
It may be difficult to download and build V8. If the script(`install.sh`) fails to run, you need to search Google to solve the problem. Good Luck :-).
